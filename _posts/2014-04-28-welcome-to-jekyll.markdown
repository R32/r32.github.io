You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight as %}
package;

import flash.display.Sprite;

class Mian extends Sprite{
	public funciton new(){
		super();
		trace("hello,world!");
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

 * 把utf-8 改回ANSI
